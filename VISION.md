# VISION

## Make the web accessible to everyone

We are greatly inspired by the mission statement of [Skypack](https://skypack.dev) and also believe that they portrait some really good values to go after.


### No more npm install dependencies
The main mission of this project is to make development experience of building web applications a pleasant one. Rather than overwhelmed by a large of number of npm dependencies and package installation, this tool offers the right way of using Javascript frameworks and libraries in the browser.

### No lock-in for developer tooling
Ofcourse, you will be needing some packages to improve the overall development experience, but you are not locked with any kind of tools and libraries from this project. You are free to choose any tool, that's why we don't generate a `package.json` in the boilerplate.

### ESM is the future of the web

### The Browser is the platform
Whatever we build in the development phase eventually going to run in the browser, then why not choose a path to serve dependencies directly in the browser rather than going through a tough and tedious phase of build and compilation.
